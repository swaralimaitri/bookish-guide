Project Title: 
Crop Production Analysis in India

Problem Statement: 
The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is
expected to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are
taking place on the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel
Business-to-Business collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective,
which aims to facilitate the collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to
associated business domains, in an effective and flexible manner.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India
ranging from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to
predict crop production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and
metrics that influence crop production.

India-Crop-Production-Data-Analysis:
India is an agricultural country and approximately 60% of the population work in this industry directly or indirectly. And this industry contributes about 18% of total GDP.

Motivation:
India has population of nearly 1.5 billion. And this thought intrigued me if India is able to produce to feed its population. Rainfall plays an important role in crop production. Hence I have also included rainfall data as well.
